Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network
---------------------------------------

astroNN.models.BCNN is a 4 layered convolutional neural net (2 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers) with dropout and l2 regularizers in every layers. 

You can create Bayesian CNN in astroNN using

.. code:: ipython3

    from astroNN.models import BCNN

    # And then create an object of Convolutional Neural Network classs
    bcnn_net = BCNN()

APOGEE Spectra Analysis
--------------------------------------------------

Althought in theory you can feed any 1D data to astroNN neural networks. This tutorial will only focus on spectra analysis.

.. code:: ipython3

    from astroNN.models import BCNN
    from astroNN.datasets import H5Loader

    # Load the train data from dataset first, x_train is spectra and y_train will be ASPCAP labels
    loader = H5Loader('datasets.h5')
    x_train, y_train = loader.load()

    # And then create an object of Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network classs
    bcnn_net = BNN()

    # You dont have to specify the task because its 'regression' by default. But if you are doing classification. you can set task='classification'
    bcnn_net.task = 'regression'

    # Set max_epochs to 10 for a quick result. You should train more epochs normally, especially with dropout
    bcnn_net.max_epochs = 10
    bcnn_net.train(x_train, y_train)

.. note:: You can disable astroNN data normalization via bcnn_net.data_normalization=False and do normalization yourself. But make sure you dont normalize labels with -9999 (missing labels).

After the training, you can use 'bcnn_net' in this case and call test method to test the neural network on test data. Or you can load the folder by

.. code:: ipython3

    from astroNN.models import load_folder
    bcnn_net = load_folder('astroNN_0101_run001')

    # Load the test data from dataset, x_test is spectra and y_test will be ASPCAP labels
    loader2 = H5Loader('datasets.h5')
    loader2.load_combined = False
    x_test, y_test = loader2.load()

    pred, pred_var = bcnn_net.test(x_test)  # pred contains denormalized result aka. ASPCAP labels prediction in this case


Since astroNN.models.BCNN uses Bayesian deep learning which provides uncertainty analysis features. If you want quick testing/prototyping, please use astroNN.models.CNN. You can plot aspcap label residue by

.. code:: ipython3

   bcnn_net.aspcap_residue_plot(pred, y_test, pred_var)


You can calculate jacobian which represents the output derivative to the input and see where those output is sensitive to in inputs.

.. code:: ipython3

   bcnn_net.jacobian(x_test)
