   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Getting Started
---------------
Recommended method of installation as this python package is still in active development and will update daily:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py develop

Or run the following command to install after you open a command line window in the package folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python setup.py install


Prerequisites
-------------
Anaconda 5.0.0 or above is recommanded

::

    Python 3.6 or above
    Tensorflow OR Tensorflow-gpu (1.4.0 or above)
    Keras 2.1.0 or above
    CUDA 8.0 and CuDNN 6.1 (only neccessary for Tensorflow-gpu 1.4.0)
    CUDA 9.0 and CuDNN 7.0 (only neccessary for Tensorflow-gpu 1.5.0 beta, you should only use 1.5.0 beta if and only if you are using Nvidia Volta)
    graphviz and pydot_ng are required to plot the model architecture
    tqdm and astroquery also required

| Please go to one of the following link to download a wheel locally and
  install it
| `Tensorflow`_
| `Tensorflow-gpu`_

For instruction on how to install Tensorflow, please refer to their
official website `Installing TensorFlow`_

Recommended system requirement:

::

    64-bits operating system
    CPU which supports AVX2 (2014 or later Intel CPU/2015 or later AMD CPU)
    8GB RAM or above
    Nvidia Graphics card (Optional, GTX900 series or above)
    (If using NVIDIA GPU): At least 2GB VRAM on GPU

.. note:: Only Keras with Tensorflow backend is supported

.. note:: Multi-GPU or Intel/AMD graphics is not supported. Only Windows and Linux is officially supported by Tensorflow-GPU with compatible NVIDIA graphics


Folder Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code depends on an environment variables and folder. The
environment variables is \* ``SDSS_LOCAL_SAS_MIRROR``: top-level
directory that will be used to (selectively) mirror the SDSS SAS \*
``GAIA_TOOLS_DATA``: top-level directory under which the data will be
stored \* A dedicated project folder is recommended to run astroNN,
always run astroNN under the root of project folder

How to set environment variable on different operating system: `Guide
here`_
