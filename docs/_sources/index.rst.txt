astroNN is a python package to do various kind of neural networks with APOGEE stellar
spectra DR14 and Gaia DR1 with Tensorflow and Keras. The idea is feeding
spectra into neural network and train it with ASPCAP stellar parameter
or feeding spectra into neural network and train it with Gaia DR1
parallax.

As of now, this is a python package developing for an undergraduate research
project on deep learning application in astronomy.
