astroNN is a python package to do neural network with APOGEE stellar
spectra DR14 and Gaia DR1 with Tensorflow and Keras. The idea is feeding
spectra into neural network and train it with ASPCAP stellar parameter
or feeding spectra into neural network and train it with Gaia DR1
parallax.

This is a python package developing for an undergraduate research
project by ``Henry Leung`` (Astronomy at University of Toronto) under the supervision of
Professor ``Jo Bovy`` (Astronomy at University of Toronto)

Getting Started
---------------
Recommended method of installation as this python package is still in active development and will update daily:

python setup.py develop
Or run the following command to install after you open a command line window in the package folder:

python setup.py install

>>> python setup.py develop
...     "This is a test function"
...
>>> class Test:
...             """
...     This is a test class
...     """
...     def test(self):
...             '''
...         This is a test method
...         which is defined on more than one line.
...         '''
...
>>>

>>>
