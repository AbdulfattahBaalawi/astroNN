Convolutional Neural Network class
----------------------------------

astroNN.models.CNN is a 4 layered convolutional neural net (2 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers)

You can create CNN in astroNN using

.. code:: python

    from astroNN.models import CNN

    # And then create an object of Convolutional Neural Network classs
    CNN = CNN()
