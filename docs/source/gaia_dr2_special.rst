GAIA DR2 Preparation
=====================

GAIA DR2 will be released on 25 April 2018 with data collected from 25 July 2014 to 23 May 2016 with 1.5 billion sources.

astroNN will be used to train neural network to predict intrinsic brightness of stars from APOGEE spectra trained with
GAIA DR1 parallax. This page will act as a notebook for the author (Henry) and share his latest update on GAIA DR2.
