TL;DR Introduction (~5 mins read)
==================================

.. warning:: This is a draft

This is a TL;DR introduction and everything will be simple

Checklist
--------------

You should close this documentation and go away if

1. You don't have a computer

2. You have never heard of neural network

3. You decided to use Keras with backends other than Tensorflow

4. You want to implement a 1000s layered neural network

5. You want to do hardcore AI research

!! This documentation is not for people who have never heard of neural network

!! astroNN only supports Keras with Tensorflow backend.

What does astroNN contain?
-----------------------

astroNN contains

1. Galaxy10 - a deep learning toy dataset for astronomers

2. Custom loss functions that compatible with Keras (Tensorflow backend)

3. Custom layers that compatible with Keras (Tensorflow backend)

4. Example of Bayesian Neural Net implementation (on regression only so far)

5. Examples of a bunch of other kinds of neural net


Usage Scenario
-------------------

1. Import astroNN loss functions and layers to use with Keras (Tensorflow backend)

2. Study astroNN source code and implement something yourself

3. Implement and share your model here to fellow astronomers

4. Use pre-defined models in astroNN (the models mainly for APOGEE and Gaia data)


astroNN to-do list
-------------------

If you want to contribute:

1. Fix Bayesian Neural Net loss function for classification task

2. Some example on dealing with time-series data
