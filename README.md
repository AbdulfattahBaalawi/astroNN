## Getting Started and Prerequisites

astroNN is a  python package to do neural network with APOGEE stellar spectra DR14 and Gaia DR1 with Tensorflow and Keras.
The idea is feeding spectra into neural network and train it with ASPCAP stellar parameter or feeding spectra into neural
network and train it with Gaia DR1 parallax.

This is a python package developing for an undergraduate research project by `Henry W.H. Leung (Toronto)` under the 
supervision of Professor `Jo Bovy, Unviersity of Toronto Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.`
#### Still in Active Development!!!!

#### Currently not working, please download astroNN committed at least before 7 Dec!!!
