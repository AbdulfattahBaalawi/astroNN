A python package to do neural network in stellar spectra with Tensorflow
#### !!!Still in Development!!!!


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

***This python package must be using with Tensorflow 1.4.0 (As of 14 Oct 2017, Tensorflow 1.4.0 still in beta and you have to compile it from source)

***This package has no Keras dependency, I have migrated it to Tensorflow. You dont need to install Keras anymore

```
Python 3.6 or above (Anaconda 5.0.0 64bit is recommended)
Tensorflow 1.4.0 or above
Tensorflow-gpu 1.4.0 or above is recommended
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
python setup.py install
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
